# Project Description

**Team:** Hunter Kauffman and John O'Neal<br>
**Course:** ILCC Intro to Programming Logic CIS-125-E100

For your first projects you will be working in your groups to complete the following task:

Create a point of sale (PoS) application for a new coffee shop.

The description of the task is intentionally ambiguous to give you freedom to show me what you are capable of.

Some requirements:

- You must use objects. For each member of your group you must contribute at least 1 super-class, 2 sub-classes, and 2 structures. Be sure to label each class appropriately so I can attribute them to the proper individual.
- All classes must include fields and methods.
- You must sketch out a user interface. I don't expect you to be artists, but your work must be understandable and professional. Use straight edges and compasses when appropriate. Make these to scale as best you can. I should see at least several different forms, where each member has contributed equally.
- The previous point mandates that the application be event-driven!

Those are the only hard requirements. If anyone edits someone else's work, ensure that it is properly referenced/noted.
